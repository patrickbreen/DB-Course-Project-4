To generate all of the results, run the main method of TestTupleGeneratorBeforeOptim.java 
(for before optimization results) and TestTupleGeneratorAfterOptim.java (for after optimization results).
In this main method, you can see all the results, and be sure to switch between the
 .sql schemas for before and after optimization results.
 
 All output is written to stdout.
 
 Word and Excel files in the root directory show further results and analysis.
 
 The ScriptRunner class was copied from an online repository, (as shown in the license).
 It allows more convenient sql script running through a JDBC connection.
